Description: This workshop delves into the rapidly advancing field of personalized cancer
  treatment, emphasizing how treatments can be tailored to individual patients
  based on their unique molecular profiles. Participants will gain a foundational 
  understanding of pharmacogenomics, focusing specifically on cancer biomarker 
  analysis, and will be guided through a comprehensive workflow from basic 
  concepts to advanced biomarker discovery techniques. Participants will be 
  introduced to the [`PharmacoGx` package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PharmacoGx.html) 
  and how to use it to analyze pharmacogenomics data.
  Through hands-on tutorials and practical exercises, participants will learn how 
  to extract, analyze, and visualize data to identify robust cancer biomarkers, 
  with transferable skills applicable to other areas of disease research.
